# CoreGO

CoreGO is the foundation layer for the Core ecosystem. Module: `dappco.re/go`.

## What CoreGO Provides

| Primitive | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `Core` | Central container — everything registers here |
| `Service` | Lifecycle-managed component (Startable/Stoppable return Result) |
| `Action` | Named callable with panic recovery + entitlement |
| `Task` | Composed sequence of Actions |
| `Registry[T]` | Thread-safe named collection (universal brick) |
| `Command` | Path-based CLI command tree |
| `Process` | Managed execution (Action sugar over go-process) |
| `API` | Remote streams (protocol handlers + Drive) |
| `Entitlement` | Permission gate (default permissive, consumer replaces) |
| `ACTION`, `QUERY` | Anonymous broadcast + request/response |
| `Data`, `Drive`, `Fs`, `Config`, `I18n` | Built-in subsystems |

## Quick Example

```go
package main

import "dappco.re/go"

func main() {
    c := core.New(
        core.WithOption("name", "agent-workbench"),
        core.WithService(cache.Register),
        core.WithServiceLock(),
    )
    c.Run()
}
```

## API Specification

The full contract is `docs/RFC.md` (21 sections, 1476 lines). An agent should be able to write a service from RFC.md alone.
